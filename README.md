<h1>SR9011 vs YK11 – What I Learned After Testing Both</h1>

<p>In this post, I’ll break down what it was like running <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>YK11</strong> personally. These aren’t just products I looked up—I actually cycled both, tracked results, and made notes on <strong>muscle gains, fat loss, strength, endurance</strong>, and side effects.</p>

<p>They’re very different. SR9011 is more like an endurance/metabolic modulator. YK11 is a full-blown myostatin inhibitor. I used them in separate cycles—YK11 for bulking, SR9011 for cutting. Here’s what happened.</p>

<h2>SR9011 – The Fat Loss SARM With Crazy Endurance Effects</h2>

<p><strong>SR9011</strong> isn’t technically a SARM—it’s a <strong>Rev-ErbA agonist</strong> that helps control your circadian rhythm and metabolism. I ran it solo for <strong>6 weeks at 30mg/day (split into 3 doses)</strong> during a summer cut. No PCT needed.</p>

<h3>My Results on SR9011:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insane increase in cardio performance by Week 2</li>
  <li>Noticeable fat loss without losing muscle</li>
  <li>No hunger increase (actually decreased appetite)</li>
  <li>Sleep quality went up even while training hard</li>
  <li>No suppression or hormonal impact at all</li>
</ul>

<p>This stuff is crazy effective for cutting. I paired it with HIIT 3x/week and a calorie deficit. It felt like I was burning fuel nonstop, and I didn’t crash like I usually do mid-diet. There were <strong>zero side effects</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Supercharged endurance</li>
  <li>Enhances fat loss without catabolism</li>
  <li>No hormonal suppression</li>
  <li>Improves sleep and energy rhythm</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Needs to be dosed multiple times daily (short half-life)</li>
  <li>Not good for bulking or strength</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Cardio Performance, Stamina</p>

<h2>YK11 – Pure Size and Strength Gains</h2>

<p>I used <strong>YK11</strong> for a bulk cycle at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong>. It’s often called a SARM, but it’s really a <strong>myostatin blocker with steroid-like activity</strong>. It helped me pack on mass fast, but there are trade-offs.</p>

<h3>My Results on YK11:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Visible size gains in shoulders, chest, and arms</li>
  <li>Massive pumps (especially from Week 3 on)</li>
  <li>Strength exploded on bench and overhead press</li>
  <li>Mild shutdown by the end of Week 5</li>
  <li>Dry muscle look, not puffy</li>
</ul>

<p>This compound delivers if you want serious mass. But it’s not for beginners. I ran a mild PCT afterward (nolva and test booster for 3 weeks). I also drank 4+ liters of water daily—YK11 can be harsh on joints if you don’t stay hydrated.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Huge strength and size gains</li>
  <li>Leads to hard, dense muscle</li>
  <li>Boosts Follistatin (myostatin inhibitor)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Moderate suppression after Week 4</li>
  <li>Can cause joint pain without proper hydration</li>
  <li>Needs PCT</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Bulking, Strength, Experienced Lifters</p>

<h2>SR9011 vs YK11 – Which One Should You Use?</h2>

<p>They’re completely different tools. It’s like comparing a fat-burning engine to a muscle-building wrecking ball. Here’s the head-to-head breakdown:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Compound</th>
      <th>Main Goal</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>
      <th>Performance Boost</th>
      <th>Muscle Growth</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>SR9011</strong></td>
      <td>Fat Loss / Endurance</td>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>High (Cardio + Sleep)</td>
      <td>Low</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>YK11</strong></td>
      <td>Mass / Strength</td>
      <td>Moderate</td>
      <td>Moderate (Lifting)</td>
      <td>Very High</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Use <strong>SR9011</strong> for a <strong>cutting phase or endurance training</strong>. Use <strong>YK11</strong> if your goal is <strong>pure size and strength</strong>. Don’t stack them unless you’re advanced and know what you’re doing.</p>

<h2>My Testing Process (Quick Breakdown)</h2>

<p>I run all SARMs solo with clean diet and consistent training. I test:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily strength levels (compound lifts)</li>
  <li>Endurance metrics (VO2 and HIIT output)</li>
  <li>Muscle measurements every 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Bloodwork before and after cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing is based on theory—I track everything. My feedback is based on <strong>real-world training and results</strong>.</p>

<h3>Does SR9011 suppress testosterone?</h3>
<p>No, it doesn’t affect hormones at all. It’s non-suppressive.</p>

<h3>Is YK11 stronger than SR9011?</h3>
<p>Yes. YK11 is way more anabolic and affects muscle growth, while SR9011 mainly boosts fat burning and endurance.</p>

<h3>Can I use SR9011 with YK11?</h3>
<p>You could stack them, but it’s not for beginners. Make sure you have PCT and recovery protocols ready.</p>

<h3>Which one is safer long term?</h3>
<p>SR9011. It’s non-hormonal, non-suppressive, and has minimal side effects.</p>

<h2>Final Take</h2>

<p>If you want to <strong>shred fat and boost stamina</strong>, SR9011 is one of the cleanest options you can run. No suppression, no crash, just results. If your goal is <strong>mass and raw power</strong>, YK11 gets you there—but make sure you’re ready for the side effects.</p>

<p>Pick based on your goal, not hype. And always get bloodwork, hydrate, and train hard. That’s the only real shortcut.</p>
